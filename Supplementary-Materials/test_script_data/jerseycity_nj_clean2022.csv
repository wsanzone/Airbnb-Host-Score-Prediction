Incorporated as a town in 1852, it later merged with Jersey City in 1869. The boundaries of the Heights are Paterson Plank Road on the north; the City of Hoboken on the east; Highway 139 on the south; and the Hackensack River and Pennon Creek on the west. This area (Zip 07307 & partial 07306) has an estimated population of 60,000 people according to data from the U.S. Census 2000.<br /><br />The Heights area is comprised mostly of two and three family houses, and remains traditionally middle-class. Perched high atop the palisades on the western banks of the Hudson River, the Heights sits 100 feet above sea level and consequently the City of Hoboken. Along the east are Palisade Buffaloed Ogden Avenues, both of which offer stunning views of the Manhattan skyline especially when standing in Riverview Fisk Park.
