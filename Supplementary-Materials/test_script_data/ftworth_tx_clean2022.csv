Count Capps, who was in the laundry business and associated with W.B. Fishburn Cleansers and Cascade Laundry, built a guesthouse on the property in 1934.  The main house was built a few years later, and Capps and his wife, Reba lived at the lake from 1942 - 1950.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The first floor of this large two-story eclectic residence is constructed of concrete and concrete block, with a shingled second story above.  Wings to either side of the main house give the structure a stretching, horizontal feel.  The current owner has lived at the property since 1979.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Guests have use of the very large semi private swimming pool. The guest in the guesthouse has access to the pool. Also, there is a  newly constructed fishing dock with bench and ladder for guests ","The house was built during the heyday of Casino Amusement Park. Pictures of the park are hung in the hallway of the house. Every window in the house offers a scenic view of either the grounds to the north or the lake to the south. Casino Park is adjacent to the property which is gated and completely private.  Very close to shopping, several grocery stores are within 2 miles as well as restaurants within that perimeter:  Mexican Inn, Spring Creek, Chiles, Applebees, Ginger Browns, Oshi Sushi, Panda China, Panera.  Fast Food: Chick Filet, Taco Cabana, Taco Bueno, Sonic, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, Popeyes, Chicken Express.  Some offer military and senior discounts.  Close by are my personal favorite for Tex Mex, Mezcales, who offers a $4.00 margarita and El Paseo who has a 4 - 6 pm Happy Hour.  Both have military discounts (but not on the ritas!)",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-41963943/original/763e7216-51a7-4ffc-822d-438103b1144f.jpeg,5833351,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5833351,Barbara,2013-04-08,"Lakeside, Texas, United States",0.95,1.0,0.0,Fort Worth,0.0,"['email', 'phone']",1.0,1.0,District 7,32.8171,-97.45621,Entire home,Entire home/apt,10,2.5,3.0,3.0,"[""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Shared pool"", ""Wifi"", ""Oven"", ""TV"", ""Hot water"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Essentials"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Stove"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Backyard"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Private entrance"", ""Dryer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Heating"", ""Lake access"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Conditioner"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Microwave"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Washer"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Shampoo"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Hangers"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Iron"", ""First aid kit""]",288.0,2,28,1,15,28,43,43,2022-06-08,79,32,3,2020-02-09,2022-05-30,4.8,4.82,4.7,4.94,4.92,4.95,4.78,1,2,2.78,1
